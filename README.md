# TimbR
R code for impulse excitation method. The code was developed for use with wood, but will work with other materials (perhaps with some adaptation)

## Getting Started

The code consists of functions and scripts.  The functions perform basic tasks and the scripts do more complicated tasks using the functions.  Use of this code requires some familiarity with R, but can be used by beginners. 

### Prerequisites

Aside from R itself https://www.r-project.org/ the code depends on two R packages, which also must be installed

Package tuneR
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tuneR 

Package seewave 
https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=seewave 

### Installing

Download the functions and scripts of interest.  Run the code for the functions (so they are loaded into R environment), then run the script / portion of script / own script according to your requirements 

## Built With

[R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

## Contributing

Improved code and new code is welcome. Please contact the project lead
